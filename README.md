## Frida's website

It is shamefully based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)'s website. This is
tacky, unfortunate and meant as placeholder until we find a contributor with
design skills. Frida is rather niche which means without a website we'll never
find that person. Chicken and egg problem basically. :(
