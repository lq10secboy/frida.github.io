    <p>You may have wondered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why a Python API, but JavaScript debugging logic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you can now do this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>npm install frida</code></pre></div>

<p>We just brought you brand new <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida-node">Node.js bindings</a>,
and they are fully asynchronous:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6ecae99945ccba47427a.js"> </script>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida-node/blob/46a5f92203ab86978a2af68d6c926d6d2b63fbe7/examples/interactive.js">examples</a>
to get an idea what the API looks like. It’s pretty much a 1:1 mapping of the
API provided by the Python bindings, but following Node.js / JavaScript
conventions like camelCased method-names, methods returning ES6 <em>Promise</em>
objects instead of blocking, etc.</p>

<p>Now, combine this with <a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/">NW.js</a> and you can build
your own desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all the way through.</p>

<p>So, brand new Node.js bindings; awesome! We did not stop there, however.
But first, a few words about the future. I am excited to announce that I have
just started a company with the goal of sponsoring part-time development of
Frida. By offering reverse-engineering and software development expertise,
the goal is to generate enough revenue to pay my bills and leave some time
to work on Frida. Longer term I’m hoping there will also be demand for help
adding features or integrating Frida into third-party products.
In the meantime, however, if you know someone looking for reverse-engineering
or software development expertise, I would really appreciate it if you could
kindly refer them to get in touch. Please see <a href="https://github.com/oleavr/cv/raw/master/oleavr.pdf">my CV</a>
for details.</p>

<p>That aside, let’s get back to the release. Next up: 32-bit Linux support!
Even <em>Stalker</em> has been ported. Not just that, the Linux backend can even do
cross-architecture injection like we do on the other platforms. This means a
64-bit Frida process, e.g. your Python interpreter, can inject into a 32-bit
process. The other direction works too.</p>

<p>Another awesome update is that <a href="https://github.com/Tyilo">Tyilo</a> contributed
<a href="https://github.com/frida/frida-python/commit/daf1a310670588e5672af2205658598be342c2e2">improvements</a>
to <em>frida-trace</em> so it now uses man-pages for auto-generating the log handlers.
Awesome, huh? But there’s even more goodies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>frida-server</em> ports are now recycled, so if you’re using Frida on Android
you won’t have to keep forwarding ports unless you’re actually attaching to
multiple processes at the same time.</li>
  <li>Linux and Android <code>spawn()</code> support has been improved to also support PIE
binaries.</li>
  <li>Android stability and compatibility improvements.</li>
  <li>Mac and Linux build system have been revamped, and make it easy to build just
the parts that you care about; and maybe even some components you didn’t even
know were there that were previously not built by default.</li>
  <li>Python bindings have a minor simplification so instead of
<code>frida.attach(pid).session.create_script()</code> it’s simply just
<code>frida.attach(pid).create_script()</code>. This is just like in the brand
new Node.js bindings, and the reason we had to bump the major version.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the gist of it. Please help spread the word by sharing this post across
the inter-webs. We’re still quite small as an open source project, so
word-of-mouth marketing means a lot to us.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <p>It’s time for a new and exciting release! Key changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No more kernel panics on Mac and iOS! Read the full story
<a href="https://medium.com/@oleavr/diy-kernel-panic-os-x-and-ios-in-10-loc-c250d9649159">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Mac and iOS injector performs manual mapping of Frida’s dylib. This means
we’re able to attach to heavily sandboxed processes.</li>
  <li>The CLI tools like <em>frida-trace</em>, <em>frida-repl</em>, etc., have brand new support
for spawning processes:</li>
</ul>

Target process terminated.
Stopping...
<span class="err">$</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>Usability improvements in <em>frida-repl</em> and <em>frida-discover</em>.</li>
  <li>First call to <code>DeviceManager.enumerate_devices()</code> does a better job and
also gives you the currently connected iOS devices, so for simple applications
or scripts you no longer have to subscribe to updates if you require the
device to already be present.</li>
  <li>The python API now provides you with <code>frida.get_usb_device(timeout = 0)</code> and
<code>frida.get_remote_device()</code> for easy access to iOS and remote/Android
devices.</li>
  <li>The <code>onEnter</code> and <code>onLeave</code> callbacks passed to <code>Interceptor.attach()</code> may
access <code>this.registers</code> to inspect CPU registers, which is really useful
when dealing with custom calling conventions.</li>
  <li><code>console.log()</code> logs to the console on your application’s side instead of
the target process. This change is actually why we had to bump the major
version for this release.</li>
  <li>Android 5.0 compatibility, modulo ART support.</li>
  <li>Brand new support for Android/x86. Everything works except the Dalvik
integration; please get in touch if you’d like to help out with a pull-request
to fix that!</li>
</ul>

<p>Want to help out? Have a look at our <a href="http://www.frida.re/docs/gsoc-ideas-2015/">GSoC 2015 Ideas Page</a>
to get an overview of where we’d like to go next.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Update 2am:</strong> An iOS issue slipped through the final testing, so we
just pushed 2.0.1 to remedy this.</p>

<p><strong>Update 11pm:</strong> Thanks to your excellent feedback we found a critical
bug when using Frida on Windows with certain iOS device configurations.
Please upgrade to 2.0.2 and let us know if you run into any issues.</p>

    <p>Tired of waiting for Frida to attach to 32-bit processes on 64-bit Mac
or iOS systems? Or perhaps <code>frida-trace</code> takes a while to resolve functions?
If any of the above, or none of it, then this release is for you!</p>

<p>Attaching to 32-bit processes on Mac/iOS hosts has been optimized, and instead
of seconds this is now a matter of milliseconds. That’s however specific to
Darwin OSes; this release also speeds up enumeration of module exports on
all OSes. This is now 75% faster, and should be very noticable when using
<code>frida-trace</code> and waiting for it to resolve functions.</p>

<p>Also, as an added bonus, teardown while attached to multiple processes no
longer crashes on Darwin and Linux.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <p>It’s release o’clock, and time for some bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iOS 8.1 is now supported, and the ARM64 support is better than ever.</li>
  <li>The iOS USB transport no longer disconnects when sending a burst of data to
the device. This would typically happen when using <code>frida-trace</code> and tracing
a bunch of functions, resulting in a burst of data being sent over the wire.
This was actually <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11059">a generic networking issue affecting Mac and iOS</a>,
but was very reproducible when using Frida with a tethered iOS device.</li>
  <li>Eliminated crashes on shutdown of the Python interpreter.</li>
  <li>The <code>onEnter</code> and <code>onLeave</code> callbacks in <code>frida-trace</code> scripts are now called
with <code>this</code> bound to the correct object, which means that it’s bound to an
object specific to that thread and invocation, and not an object shared by
all threads and invocations.</li>

<p>Stalker improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The engine no longer pre-allocates a fixed chunk of 256 MB per thread being
traced, and now grows this dynamically in a reentrancy-safe manner.</li>
  <li>Eliminated a bug in the cache lookup logic where certain blocks would always
result in a cache miss. Those blocks thus got recompiled every time they
were about to get executed, slowing down execution and clogging up the cache
with more and more entries, and eventually running out of memory.</li>
  <li>Relocation of RIP-relative <code>cmpxchg</code> instruction is now handled correctly.</li>

    <p>This latest release includes a bunch of enhancements and bug fixes.
Some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder of Frida’s internals have been migrated from udis86 to
Capstone, which means that our Stalker is now able to trace binaries with
very recent x86 instructions. Part of this work also included battle-testing
it on 32- and 64-bit binaries on Windows and Mac, and all known issues have
now been resolved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Memory.protect()</code> has been added to the JavaScript API, allowing you to
easily change page protections. For example:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nx">Memory</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">protect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ptr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;0x1234&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">4096</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rw-&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>Process.enumerateThreads()</code> omits Frida’s own threads so you don’t have to
worry about them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Python 3 binaries are now built against Python 3.4.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So with this release out, let’s talk about <a href="https://github.com/frida/cryptoshark">CryptoShark</a>:</p>

<p>How is this implemented you ask? That’s the cool part. Frida already uses the
amazing <a href="http://www.capstone-engine.org/">Capstone disassembly framework</a>
behind the scenes, and thus it makes perfect sense to make it available to the
JavaScript runtime. Have a look at the
<a href="http://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/">JavaScript API Reference</a> for all
the details.</p>

    <p>It’s time for a bugfix release. Highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compatibility with the Pangu iOS jailbreak on ARM64. The issue is that RWX
pages are not available like they used to be with the evad3rs jailbreak.</li>
  <li>Fix occasional target process crash when detaching.</li>
  <li>Fix crash when trying to attach to a process the second time after failing
to establish the first time. This primarily affected Android users, but could
happen on any OS when using <code>frida-server</code>.</li>
  <li>Faster and more reliable injection on Linux/x86-64 and Android/ARM.</li>
  <li>Fix issues preventing hooking of HeapFree and friends on Windows.</li>
  <li>Upgraded GLib, libgee, json-glib and Vala dependencies for improved
performance and bugfixes.</li>
  <li>No more resource leaks. Please report if you find any.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also new since 1.6.0, as covered in my <a href="https://medium.com/@oleavr/build-a-debugger-in-5-minutes-1-5-51dce98c3544">blog post</a>, there is now a full-

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>As some of you may have noticed, Frida recently got brand new Android support,
allowing you to easily instrument code just like on Windows, Mac, Linux and iOS.
This may sound cool and all, but Android does run a lot of Java code, which
means you’d only be able to observe the native side-effects of whatever
that code was doing. You could of course use Frida’s FFI API to poke your way
into the VM, but hey, shouldn’t Frida just do that dirty plumbing for you?
Of course it should!</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like in action:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nx">Dalvik</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Activity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Dalvik</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;android.app.Activity&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">Activity</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onResume</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">implementation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;onResume() got called! Let&#39;s call the original implementation&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onResume</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>Dalvik.perform()</code> call takes care of attaching your thread to the VM,
and isn’t necessary in callbacks from Java. Also, the first time you call
<code>Dalvik.use()</code> with a given class name, Frida will interrogate the VM and
build a JavaScript wrapper on-the-fly. Above we ask for the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a>
class and replace its implementation of <code>onResume</code> with our own version,
and proceed to calling the original implementation after sending a message
to the debugger (running on your Windows, Mac or Linux machine). You could
of course choose to not call the original implementation at all, and emulate
its behavior. Or, perhaps you’d like to simulate an error scenario:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nx">Dalvik</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Activity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Dalvik</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;android.app.Activity&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Exception</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Dalvik</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;java.lang.Exception&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">Activity</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onResume</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">implementation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nx">Exception</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">$new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Oh noes!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So there you just instantiated a Java Exception and threw it straight from
your JavaScript implementation of <code>Activity.onResume</code>.</p>

<p>This release also comes with some other runtime goodies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Memory.copy(dst, src, n)</code>: just like memcpy</li>
  <li><code>Memory.dup(mem, size)</code>: short-hand for <code>Memory.alloc()</code> followed by
<code>Memory.copy()</code></li>
  <li><code>Memory.writeXXX()</code>: the missing <code>Memory.read()</code> counterparts: S8, S16, U16,
S32, U32, S64, U64, ByteArray, Utf16String and AnsiString</li>
  <li><code>Process.pointerSize</code> to make your scripts more portable</li>
  <li><code>NativePointer</code> instances now have a convenient <code>isNull()</code> method</li>
  <li><code>NULL</code> constant so you don’t have to do <code>ptr("0")</code> all over the place</li>
  <li><code>WeakRef.bind(value, fn)</code> and <code>WeakRef.unbind(id)</code> for the hardcore:
The former monitors <code>value</code> so <code>fn</code> gets called as soon as <code>value</code> has been
garbage-collected, or the script is about to get unloaded. It returns an
id that you can pass to <code>unbind()</code> for explicit cleanup.
This API is useful if you’re building a language-binding, where you need to
free native resources when a JS value is no longer needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <p>Some of you experienced issues injecting into processes on Windows, as well as
crashes on iOS. Here’s a new release bringing some serious improvements to
Frida’s internals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>V8 has been upgraded to 3.25 in order to fix the iOS stability issues. This
also means new features (like ECMAScript 6) and improved performance on all
platforms. Another nice aspect is that Frida now depends on a V8 version
that runs on 64-bit ARM, which paves the way for porting Frida itself to
AArch64.</li>
  <li>The Windows injector has learned some new tricks and will get you into even
more processes. A configuration error was also discovered in the Windows
build system, which explains why some of you were unable to inject into
some processes.</li>
  <li>For those of you building Frida on Windows, the build system there now
depends on VS2013. This means XP is no longer supported, though it is still
possible to build with the <code>v120_xp</code> toolchain if any of you still depend
on that, so let me know if this is a deal-breaker for you.</li>
  <li>The recently added support for <code>this.lastError</code> (Windows) is now working
correctly.</li>

<p>That’s all for now. Let us know what you think, and if you like Frida, please

    <p>Another release — this time with some new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objective-C integration for Mac and iOS. Here’s an example to whet your
appetite:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">UIAlertView</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">ObjC</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;UIAlertView&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cm">/* iOS */</span>

        <span class="nx">ptr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;OK&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nx">ptr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span>

    <span class="nx">view</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">release</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>Module.enumerateExports()</code> now also enumerates exported variables and not
just functions. The <code>onMatch</code> callback receives an <code>exp</code> object where the
<code>type</code> field is either <code>function</code> or <code>variable</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get the full scoop on the ObjC integration, have a look at the
<a href="http://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/">JavaScript API reference</a>.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>This release brings USB device support in the command-line tools, and
adds <code>frida-ps</code> for enumerating processes both locally and remotely.</p>

<p>For example to enumerate processes on your tethered iOS device:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>frida-ps -U</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>-U</code> switch is also accepted by <code>frida-trace</code> and <code>frida-discover</code>.</p>

<p>Docs how to set this up on your iOS device will soon be added to the website.</p>

<p>However, that’s not the most exciting part. Starting with this release,
Frida got its first contribution since the HN launch.
<a href="https://github.com/pmorici">Pete Morici</a> dived in and contributed support
for specifying module-relative functions in <code>frida-trace</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>frida-trace -a <span class="s1">&#39;kernel32.dll+0x1234&#39;</span></code></pre></div>

    <p>This release simplifies the licensing and fixes bugs reported by the community
since the HN launch.</p>

<p>Primarily:
- Relicense remaining GPLv3+ Frida components to LGPLv2.1+ (same as frida-gum).
- Tracer works on 64-bit with function addresses in the upper range
- Linux build links with Frida’s own libraries instead of the build machine’s
  corresponding libraries.</p>
